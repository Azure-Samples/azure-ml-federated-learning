# Federated Learning in Azure ML

Federated Learning (FL) is a framework where one trains a single ML model on distinct datasets that cannot be gathered in a single central location. This enables companies and institutions to comply with regulations related to data location and data access while allowing for innovation and personalization.

This repo provides some code samples for running a federated learning pipeline in the Azure Machine Learning platform.

:warning: Running a full federated learning pipeline raises **security questions that you need to address** before using this repository for production purpose. Please consider this repository as a sample only.

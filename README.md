# Federated Learning in Azure ML

:construction: Work In Progress :construction:

This repo provides some code samples for running a federated learning pipeline in the Azure Machine Learning platform.

:warning: Running a full federated learning pipeline raises **security questions that you need to address** before using this repository for production purpose. Please consider this repository as a sample only.

Federated Learning (FL) is a framework where one trains a single ML model on distinct datasets that cannot be gathered in a single central location. This enables companies and institutions to comply with regulations related to data location and data access, while allowing for innovation and personalization.

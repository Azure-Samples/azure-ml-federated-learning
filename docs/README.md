## Why should you consider Federated Learning?

:construction: Work In Progress :construction:

Federated Learning (FL) is a framework where one trains a single ML model on distinct datasets that cannot be gathered in a single central location. This enables companies and institutions to comply with regulations related to data location and data access, while allowing for innovation and personalization.

# Run a Federated Learning Demo in 5 mins

In this tutorial, you will:

* Provision a fully functional environment in your own Azure subscription
* Run a sample federated learning pipeline in Azure ML

## Prerequisites

To enjoy this quickstart, you will need to:

* have an active [Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com) that you can use for development purposes,
* have permissions to create resources, set permissions, and create identities in this subscription (or at least in one resource group),
* [install the Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

## Create a sandbox environment

Click on the buttons below depending on your goal. It will open in Azure Portal a page to deploy the resources in your subscription. You can find other available sandbox setups in our [sandboxes provisioning page](./provisioning/sandboxes.md).

This will provision a Federated Learning setup with 3 [_internal silos_](./concepts/glossary.md), _i.e._ silos that are in the same Azure tenant as the orchestrator. You will be to run the examples in the `./examples/pipelines` directory.

<a style="color:darkorange">These sandboxes require you to be the _Owner_ of an Azure resource group.</a> _Contributor_ role is not enough. In your subscription, depending on admin policies, even if you can create a resource group yourself, you might not be the _Owner_ of it. Without ownership, you will not be able to set the RBAC roles necessary for provisioning these sandboxes. Ask your subscription administrator for help.

This setup works quick but only for this quickstart code and is intended for demo purposes. |

This works with all our samples including both horizontal FL and vertical FL. |

> Notes:
>
> * If someone already provisioned a demo with the same name in your subscription, change **Demo Base Name** parameter to a unique value.
> * To deploy a sandbox manually using bicep, check our [configurable sandboxes tutorial](./provisioning/sandboxes.md#configurable-sandboxes).

## Launch the demo experiment

In this section, we'll use a sample python script to submit a federated learning experiment to Azure ML. The script will need to connect to your newly created Azure ML workspace first.

1. Create a conda environment with all the python dependencies, then activate it.

    ```bash
    conda env create --file ./examples/pipelines/environment.yml
    conda activate fl_experiment_conda_env
    ```

    Alternatively, you can install the dependencies directly:

    ```bash
    python -m pip install -r ./examples/pipelines/requirements.txt
    ```

2. To connect to your newly created Azure ML workspace, you'll need to provide the following info in the sample python script as CLI arguments.

    ```bash
    python ./examples/pipelines/fl_cross_silo_literal/submit.py --subscription_id <subscription_id> --resource_group <resource_group> --workspace_name <workspace_name> --example MNIST
    ```
    > Notes: 
        > * You can use --offline flag when running the job to just build and validate pipeline without submitting it.
        > * Differential privacy is disabled by default, but you can quickly turn it on by setting the `config.yaml` file's `dp` parameter to `true`.
    
    Note: you can also create a `config.json` file at the root of this repo to provide the above information. Follow the instructions on how to get this from the [Azure ML documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/how-to-configure-environment#workspace).

    ```json
    {
        "subscription_id": "<subscription-id>",
        "resource_group": "<resource-group>",
        "workspace_name": "<workspace-name>"
    }
    ```

    >Note: The `config.json` is in our `.gitignore` to avoid pushing it to git.

The script will submit the experiment to Azure ML. **It should open a direct link to the experiment** in the Azure ML UI.

If not, the script will print the URL to use in clear:

```log

The url to see your live job running is returned by the sdk:
https://ml.azure.com/runs/.....
```

### Look at the pipeline in the AML UI

Go to the above URL and your pipeline would look similar to this:

If you want to look at the pipeline metrics, go to the "Job overview" (top-right corner) and then click on the "Metrics(preview)". The following screenshot shows what that would look like.

You can also create your own custom graph by clicking on the "Create custom chart" icon. Here is a sample custom chart showing the "Training Loss" of multiple silos in one graph.

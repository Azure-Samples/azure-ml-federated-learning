# Roadmap to Federated Learning on Azure ML

## Contents
Here we propose a roadmap for onboarding to Federated Learning on Azure ML. The roadmap follows the Crawl-Walk-Run-Fly framework, where we suggest to start with a simple example, and then progressively add more complexity.

## :turtle: Crawl

>**:checkered_flag: Goal: kick the tires and get a feel for the technology.**

## :walking: Walk

>**:checkered_flag: Goal: provision a custom setup, start working with non-sensitive data.**

## :running: Run

>**:checkered_flag: Goal: provision a custom and _secure_ setup, connect to sensitive data, train real FL model.**

## :airplane: Fly

>**:checkered_flag: Goal: scale up to production, introduce MLOPS.**

# EXAMPLE CONFIG FILE

# This file is intendedt to help contain all the parameters required
# to orchestrate our sample federated learning experiments.
# It is by no means necessary to run an FL experiment, just helpful.
# See submit.py for details on how to consume this file in python.

# This should work out of the box when running an experiment
# on one of our sandbox environments.

# Follow the instructions in the comments to adapt to your settings.

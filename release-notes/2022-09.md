FL Accelerator - September 2022 release

We are excited to announce the release of the September iteration of our [FL Accelerator repository](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-ml-federated-learning).

Here are the new features.
- Introduction of "factory" code to simplify the creation of FL experiments.
- Single location for all documentation.
- Auto-provisioning tools now provision a setup with _secured_ internal silos, with extra protection to prevent from exfiltrating data. Connect your own storage accounts to this setup, and easily run FL jobs on your own data!
